## Abstract {.unnumbered}

###### Introduction
The Aligned Rank Transform (ART) is a popular statistical method, commonly used when the assumptions of parametric procedures, such as normality assumptions, are not met. Its popularity stems from several Monte Carlo experiments demonstrating that the method is robust and powerful. However, contrary experimental findings suggest that ART may be less robust compared to simpler rank transformation methods, failing to adequately control Type I error rates across various scenarios, including discrete data, skewed distributions, and distributions with unequal variances. These results have not gained attention within the Human-Computer Interaction community, where ART is routinely used.

###### Objectives
This research aims to clarify the contradictory findings from previous studies by reevaluating the robustness and effectiveness of ART. Its complementary goal is to investigate the performance of alternative nonparametric methods.

###### Methods
We conducted an extensive series of Monte Carlo experiments to systematically evaluate ART across a broad range of data distributions and experimental designs. Our comparative analysis includes two alternative transformation methods: the simple rank transformation and the inverse normal transformation, along with parametric ANOVA without transformation. Additionally, we present supplementary experiments involving other competitive nonparametric methods in the [appendix](appendix_I.html).

Our experimental method is based on generalized linear models and latent variable modeling, enabling precise control over main and interaction effects across diverse distributions. Throughout our analysis, we carefully address interpretation issues arising from the definition of the null hypothesis in nonlinear models. In addition to the experiments, we explore the behavior of ART through illustrative examples and reanalyze datasets from previously published user studies.

###### Results
Our results show that ART fails under a range of discrete distributions, including binomial data and Likert-type data with 5, 7, and 11 ordinal levels. Moreover, ART systematically confounds effects in skewed distributions or distributions with unequal variances. We report results for various experimental designs, including between-subject, within-subject, and mixed designs with two or three factors.

Surprisingly, ART functions as intended only under the strict assumption of a linear model with continuous responses, equal variances, and no missing data. In all other scenarios, it performs worse than simpler rank transformation methods and, in many cases --- such as with ordinal data --- significantly worse than parametric ANOVA. Our analysis of real-world data further demonstrates that using ART often leads to incorrect conclusions. By contrast, the inverse normal transformation proves to be the most robust nonparametric method, though we also identify scenarios where it inflates errors and distorts effects.

In addition, our results show that testing interactions in the presence of multiple main effects remains a challenge for all methods. We raise awareness about previous warnings regarding the interpretation of *removable interactions*. 

###### Conclusion
We conclude that ART is a flawed statistical method and should no longer be used. We recommend prioritizing parametric modeling approaches, including linear models and their generalizations. While we propose the inverse normal transformation as a generic nonparametric alternative, we caution researchers about the limitations and potential risks of rank-based procedures.
